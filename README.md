# LTE-Cell-Tower-Optimization-Tool
A web-based tool for visualizing and optimizing LTE cell tower placements based on signal strength, coverage overlap, and user density data. It helps telecom engineers simulate and analyze real-world coverage to improve service quality.



üîß Tech Stack:

    Backend: Python (Flask), Pandas, NumPy

    Frontend: React + Leaflet.js (for interactive maps)

    Database: SQLite or PostgreSQL

    Tools: OpenCellID API (for tower data), Google Maps API

‚öôÔ∏è Key Features:

    Upload tower & user location datasets (CSV)

    Visualize coverage radius per tower on an interactive map

    Calculate overlap zones and signal interference

    Suggest optimal repositioning of towers

    Export optimization report
